**Beam Analysis ** <br />


The goal of the project is to develop a straightforward algorithm that calculates the shear force and bending moment values for a simply supported beam subjected to a moving load. Additionally, the project aims to create a web-based tool using Flask that allows users to input beam parameters, visualize the resulting shear force and bending moment diagrams, and download the analysis results as a PDF.
